# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Machinery-

 Problem Statement
In industrial manufacturing, machinery failure can lead to significant production downtime, cost overruns, and safety concerns. A key challenge is to predict machinery failures before they occur to schedule timely maintenance. The goal is to build a system that accurately identifies failure types in advance using operational data from machines.

‚úÖ Proposed Solution
The proposed system aims to predict the Failure Type of industrial machinery using historical sensor data. This includes developing a predictive model using supervised machine learning techniques.

Key steps:

1.Data Collection: Use sensor data including temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear.

2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize input features, and encode categorical variables.

3.Model Building: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning pipelines.

4.Optimization: Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.

5.Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model via IBM Watsonx for real-time prediction.
